# homepage

A Homepage project to practice thinking about Acessibility and Responsive Design.

This project follows a design brief (image files can be found in the design folder).

Some accessibility issues:

- Poor descriptive text for the external links on the site (about me/projects/foooter), possible fix using aria-labels?
- Poor text contrast in footer section fails to meet WCAG standards.
